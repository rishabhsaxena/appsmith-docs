# Triggering APIs / Queries from Widgets

## Configuring the action

The property pane has an action section where all the interactions that a user can perform with a widget are listed. We can configure the action to be taken when the interaction takes place in this section.

To configure the API / Query we want to call when a button is clicked, we can select the action in the onClick dropdown.

## Handling Success / Error

The action section also allows us to configure the action to take once an API / Query returns with a success or an error. Success / Error is determined by the HTTP status code or the query response status returned by the API / Query. We can decide to display a success or an error message by using the **Show Alert action**.
