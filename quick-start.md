## Connect your APIs

You can import your APIs via CURL or with a simple REST client interface. You can take inputs from a widget by entering **`{{ widgetName.property }}`** in side the REST interface. You can trigger the API from a widget using the property pane.

## Bind the data

You can refer to widget & API data using their name inside **`{{ }}`**. You can display an API response inside a table by adding **`{{ apiName.data }}`** to the table data property or take inputs in an API by adding **`{{ Input1.text }}`** to the params or body field.
